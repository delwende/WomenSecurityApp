</b><p dir="ltr"><b>6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</b>. </p><b>
</b><p dir="ltr"><b>(a) </b>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED 
BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE
 HAND, AND T-MOBILE AND/OR VIVOX, ON THE OTHER HAND, RELATED TO OR 
CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, OR SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ANY 
BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN 
IN COURT. This includes any claims against other parties relating to the
 Services or Software provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers 
or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in 
the same proceeding. We each also agree that this Agreement affects 
interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal 
arbitration law apply. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND 
COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE ARBITRATOR MUST 
FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A 
COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES).</p><b>
</b><p dir="ltr"><b>(b) </b>For all disputes, whether pursued in court 
or arbitration, you must first give us and/or Vivox, as applicable, an 
opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of 
your claim to T-Mobile Customer Relations, P.O. Box 37380, Albuquerque, 
NM 87176-7380 and/or to Vivox, Inc., Attn: Customer Support, 2-4 Mercer 
Road Natick, MA 01701. You, on the one hand, and we and/or Vivox, on the
 other hand, agree to negotiate with each other in good faith about your
 claim. If the claim is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the
 claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. You may 
pursue your claim in a court only under the circumstances described 
below. </p><b>
</b><p dir="ltr"><b>(c) </b>Notwithstanding the above, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO
 PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION if: (i) your claim 
qualifies, you may initiate proceedings in small claims court; or (ii) 
YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES <u>WITHIN 30 DAYS</u> FROM 
THE DATE YOU ACTIVATED THE RELEVANT SERVICES (the "Opt Out Deadline"). 
You must opt out by the Opt Out Deadline. With respect to T-Mobile, you 
may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-866-323-4405 or
 completing the opt-out form located at <u>www.T-Mobiledisputeresolution.com &lt;http://www.t-mobiledisputeresolution.com/&gt;</u>,
 and with respect to Vivox, you may opt out of these arbitration 
procedures by notifying Vivox in writing, at 2-4 Mercer Road Natick, 
01760. Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid
 and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.</p><b>
</b><p dir="ltr"><b>(d) </b>If the arbitration provision applies or you 
choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we 
and/or Vivox, as applicable, may start arbitration proceedings. To begin
 arbitration or other legal proceeding, (i) with respect to us, you must
 serve our registered agent, Corporation Services Company, at the 
address in Section 14, below, and/or (ii) with respect Vivox, you must 
serve Vivox at the address in Section 14, below. The American 
Arbitration Association (AAA) will arbitrate all disputes. For claims of
 less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for 
Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA's
 Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at
 <u>www.adr.org &lt;http://www.adr.org/&gt;</u> or by calling 
1-800-778-7879. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we and/or Vivox, 
as applicable, will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees 
for claims that total less than $75,000. For claims that total more than
 $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will
 be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. An arbitrator may 
award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a 
court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys' fees. 
In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice 
and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating 
arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party 
in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable 
attorneys' fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous,
 T-Mobile and/or Vivox, as applicable, agrees not to seek an award of 
attorneys' fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available 
under applicable law. </p><b><i>
</i></b><i></i><p dir="ltr"><i><b>(e) </b>Class Action Waiver</i>. WE 
EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN 
ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND 
NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, 
CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court or arbitrator 
determines in an action between you and us and/or Vivox, as applicable, 
that this waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be 
void as to you. If you chose to pursue your claim in court by opting out
 of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action 
Waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other 
customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise 
participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding 
without having complied with the opt out requirements above.</p><b><i>
</i></b><i></i><p dir="ltr"><i><b>(f) </b>Jury Trial Waiver</i>. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p><b>
</b><p dir="ltr"><b>7. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</b>. </p><b>
</b><p dir="ltr"><b>(a) </b>T-MOBILE, VIVOX AND THEIR LICENSORS AND
